# Remembrance Front End

This is the front end of Remembrance that successfully connects to the back end of this web application.

## Description

This app is for those who want to be the best partner they could be, whether that be a best friend, spouse or son etc.  Remembering the small things in a person is so powerful and wholesome it could even warm the hearts of the most cold-hearted people. Now obviously the super computer between our ears can only store and access so much; it’d be nice to leverage technology to ease that burden. With this app we can create personalized cards for any individual that will store the little things we’d like to remember of that person.
